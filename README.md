## Start
add your data to tripData2013 in folders such as trip_data_1.csv which will contain the trip_data_1.csv file itself

run ```python modify_csv.py``` to modify your csv file so that it splits the dates in two dates (from 2018-12-17 20:00:00 to 2018-12-17, 20:00:00 as in two different fields)
run ```python generalize.py``` to anonymize the data
